# Use a Fixed Detection Threshold

Guiding question: **Why does a threshold that works in one noise level fail in another?**

## Physical model: one number becomes one decision

P42 produced bright and dim processed cells, but brightness alone was not a
detection rule. P43 reduces one range cell to a real, signed matched-filter
amplitude (x). The target polarity is known and positive, so the detector is

\[
x \mathop{\gtrless}_{H_0}^{H_1} \gamma,
\]

where (\gamma) is one positive threshold in native amplitude units. The two
hypotheses are deliberately explicit:

\[
H_0: x=n, \qquad H_1: x=A+n, \qquad n\sim\mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2).
\]

This is not a magnitude or power detector. For a real one-sided statistic,
the target-absent false-alarm probability and target-present detection
probability are

\[
P_{FA}=Q\!\left(\frac{\gamma}{\sigma}\right), \qquad
P_D=Q\!\left(\frac{\gamma-A}{\sigma}\right),
\]

with (Q(u)=\tfrac12\operatorname{erfc}(u/\sqrt{2})). A miss is the complement
(P_{miss}=1-P_D). The script calibrates

\[
\gamma=\sigma_0 Q^{-1}(P_{FA,design})
\]

only once, at reference RMS (\sigma_0). Figure 2 shows the two conditioned
populations and the same vertical threshold.

False alarms are counted only among target-absent trials. Detections and misses
are counted only among target-present trials. Pooling every crossing into one
rate would change the denominators whenever target prevalence changed and
would no longer estimate either (P_{FA}) or (P_D).

## Baseline: absolute calibration works at its design point

At (\sigma=\sigma_0), the threshold is about 2.326 reference-noise RMS for the
chosen 1% design false-alarm probability. The positive target amplitude is
four reference-noise RMS, so most target-present samples cross while only the
upper tail of target-absent samples does.

Figure 1 supplies a finite range-profile view with known target labels. It is
useful for seeing individual crossings, but four target cells cannot estimate
a probability well. Figure 2 and the reported metrics therefore use 20,000
independent H0 trials and 20,000 independent H1 trials.

## Sweep 1: spreading the background changes both tails

The first sweep changes only (\sigma). Target amplitude (A), threshold
(\gamma), standard-normal samples, and trial count stay fixed. Therefore

\[
\frac{\gamma}{\sigma}
\]

shrinks as noise RMS grows. More target-absent samples reach the fixed
amplitude line, so (P_{FA}) rises. Because this experiment chooses
(A>\gamma), increasing the spread also moves more target-present samples below
the line, so misses rise. The common standardized samples make each change a
controlled scaling experiment rather than a comparison of lucky noise draws.

The limiting cases make the mechanism concrete. As (\sigma\to0), H0 collapses
at zero and H1 collapses at (A); because (0<\gamma<A), both false alarms and
misses approach zero. As (\sigma\to\infty), the finite offsets become small
relative to the spread and both one-sided crossing probabilities approach
one half. A fixed threshold therefore cannot preserve the 1% design value over
an arbitrary background scale.

## Sweep 2: shifting the background also breaks calibration

The second sweep keeps (\sigma=\sigma_0) and adds a positive clutter pedestal
(\mu_c) to both hypotheses:

\[
H_0:x=\mu_c+n, \qquad H_1:x=\mu_c+A+n.
\]

Now

\[
P_{FA}=Q\!\left(\frac{\gamma-\mu_c}{\sigma_0}\right).
\]

The clutter model is a visible mean shift, not a claim that all radar clutter
is Gaussian or constant. It isolates one fact: when a target-absent
distribution moves toward an absolute line, false alarms rise. Detection may
also rise because everything moved upward; that is not improved selectivity.
The false-alarm count reveals the cost.

For a large positive pedestal, both H0 and H1 cross almost always, so the
detector stops separating them. For a large negative pedestal, both cross
rarely. Operational clutter can be correlated, heavy-tailed, range-dependent,
and Doppler-dependent; later CFAR lessons introduce local background
estimation rather than treating this pedestal as a complete clutter model.

## Intentionally broken claim: hidden adaptation

The broken case divides each noise case by its known true RMS before applying
the threshold in normalized units. Algebraically its decision is

\[
\frac{x}{\sigma_{case}} > \frac{\gamma}{\sigma_0}.
\]

Its false-alarm probability stays constant because the effective native-unit
threshold is now proportional to (\sigma_{case}). That result is useful, but
it is not the fixed detector promised by P43. It uses background knowledge to
adapt every case. The script flags the fixed-threshold claim as false.

Recovery returns to (x>\gamma) in amplitude units and proves that every H0
decision matches the original sweep exactly. P45 will estimate local
background from training cells and make the adaptive rule explicit; dividing
by an oracle RMS here is only a preview, not a CFAR implementation.

## Assumptions, compatibility, and boundaries

- The target contribution has known positive polarity. A negative target or
  unknown phase requires a different statistic.
- A two-sided absolute-value detector would have
  (P_{FA}=2Q(\gamma/\sigma)); complex magnitude is Rayleigh and power is
  exponential under ideal complex Gaussian noise. Those formulas are not
  interchangeable with this lesson's one-sided real model.
- Trials are independent within each hypothesis. The two hypotheses use
  separate private-stream noise draws; sweeps reuse standardized draws only to
  isolate the changed parameter.
- The target is deterministic and does not fluctuate. P41's Swerling models
  would require averaging detection probability over target amplitude.
- Very small false-alarm probabilities require far more trials than this
  bounded visual lesson. P52 later performs dedicated false-alarm validation.
- The script uses base MATLAB operations, a private seed, five tagged figures,
  bounded arrays, and no external I/O or persistent state.
- This is a synthetic statistical model, not measured receiver calibration,
  complex range-Doppler detection, CFAR, hardware, HIL, field, or operational
  radar validation.

## Common interpretation mistakes

- A fixed normalized threshold is not a fixed amplitude threshold if the
  normalization changes with the background.
- More total threshold crossings do not mean better detection; H0 crossings
  are false alarms.
- Noise RMS, noise variance, and noise power are related but not identical:
  variance is (\sigma^2), while this amplitude threshold is measured against
  RMS (\sigma).
- The clutter-pedestal sweep changes the mean; the noise sweep changes the
  standard deviation. Both can break one absolute calibration by different
  mechanisms.
- A single plotted profile is not enough to estimate a rare-event
  probability; use conditioned repeated trials and retain their denominators.

## Dependencies and connection

[P28](../28-connect-thresholds-to-roc-curves-and-estimator-limits/) introduced
H0/H1 probability bookkeeping and threshold tradeoffs. [P41](../41-model-ground-clutter-and-swerling-targets/)
distinguished correlated clutter and fluctuating targets from white noise.
[P42](../42-create-a-full-range-doppler-map/) produced range-Doppler cells but
explicitly stopped before detection. P43 applies the first decision rule;
[P44](../44-build-an-empirical-radar-roc-curve/) will sweep the threshold and
[P45](../45-implement-1-d-cell-averaging-cfar/) will adapt it from neighboring
training cells.

## Use the Python GUI experiment

The GUI keeps the pinned source's mental model and processing order visible. The **fixed threshold** control scales the primary source variable around its documented baseline; **secondary stress** isolates the next important effect; the noise control uses a fixed retained seed so reruns are comparable.

### Prediction and sweep 1 — fixed threshold

Hold secondary stress at 0.25 and predict the response at 0.6×, 1.0×, and 1.4× baseline. State which axis feature should move, which metric should change monotonically, and which quantity should remain invariant. Run those three cases and explain any departure using the governing equations above.

### Sweep 2 — secondary stress

Restore the primary scale to 1.0. Sweep secondary stress through 0.0, 0.5, and 1.0. Separate a genuine model change from a display-scale change, and connect the response to the source lesson's limiting cases.

### Intentionally broken case and recovery

Enable **Violate the central model assumption**. The experiment applies a deterministic ambiguity, contamination, association error, or coherent-processing error appropriate to this curriculum phase. Name the violated assumption before looking at the warning callout. Recover by disabling broken mode, returning primary scale to 1.0 and secondary stress to 0.25, and verifying that the original invariant returns.

## Common mistakes to avoid in the GUI

- Changing two controls at once and attributing the result to only one.
- Reading a smooth plotted line as information that was never measured or modeled.
- Ignoring axis units, normalization, sign, or the finite record/resource ceiling.
- Treating the broken response as random software behavior instead of a named assumption failure.
