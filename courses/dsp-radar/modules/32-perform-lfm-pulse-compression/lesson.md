Guiding question: **How can a long energetic pulse achieve short-pulse range resolution?**

## Physical model: label time inside the pulse

An unmodulated long pulse occupies a long interval in fast time. Two echoes
whose leading edges are close together overlap, so pulse duration alone would
suggest poor range resolution. An LFM pulse adds a steadily changing frequency
label across that interval. Early samples have one frequency, later samples
have another, and a receiver that knows the label sequence can align them.

The complex-baseband waveform in Figure 1 is

\[
s(t)=\exp\left(j\pi k(t-T/2)^2\right),\qquad k=\frac{B}{T},
\]

for \(0\le t<T\). Its instantaneous frequency is approximately
\(f_i(t)=k(t-T/2)\), sweeping from \(-B/2\) to \(+B/2\). The magnitude stays
constant: bandwidth is carried by phase rotation, not by a short amplitude
envelope.

## The matched filter performs coherent alignment

For sampled pulse `s[m]`, the matched filter is its conjugate time reverse,

\[
h[m]=s^*[N-1-m],\qquad y[n]=\sum_m x[m]h[n-m].
\]

The script evaluates that sum explicitly before cross-checking it with base
MATLAB `conv`. At the correct echo delay every LFM phase term unwinds and adds
in phase. At other delays the phase terms mostly cancel. Figure 2 shows the raw
echoes extending across about \(cT/2\) metres; Figure 3 shows their energy
concentrated into separate delay peaks.

The convolution peak contains the matched-filter delay \(N-1\). The range axis
therefore uses

\[
R[n]=\frac{c}{2F_s}\left(n-(N-1)\right).
\]

Failing to subtract that filter delay produces a deterministic range bias.

## Bandwidth sets width; duration carries energy

For an ideal rectangular LFM spectrum, the characteristic range scale is

\[
\Delta R\approx\frac{c}{2B}.
\]

The exact full -3 dB width depends on the sampled waveform and the rectangular
time gate, so the experiment reports both measured width and the nominal
`c/(2B)` scale. Figure 4 changes only `B`: larger bandwidth produces a narrower
compressed response while pulse duration and transmitted sample count stay
fixed.

Figure 5 changes only `T`. Compressed width stays nearly fixed because `B`
stays fixed, while the time-bandwidth product \(BT\) grows. At fixed peak
power, a longer pulse contains more energy. This is the central bargain: long
duration supplies energy and large bandwidth supplies delay resolution.

## Two gain conventions that must not be mixed

With complex white sample noise of variance \(\sigma^2\), a length-\(N\)
unit-amplitude matched filter has a coherent per-sample SNR gain of
\(N=F_sT\). Radar texts commonly quote pulse-compression gain \(BT\), which
references the input noise to the waveform's \(B\)-Hz receiver bandwidth:

\[
\frac{\mathrm{SNR}_{out}}{\mathrm{SNR}_{in,B\text{-Hz}}}
=F_sT\frac{B}{F_s}=BT.
\]

The baseline prints both numbers and labels the convention. The measured
processing gain uses a seeded noise-only matched-filter output and the same
`B`-Hz input convention. It is expected to be near, not exactly equal to,
\(10\log_{10}(BT)\) because it is one finite noise record.

## The mismatch limit

Figure 6 deliberately builds a replica with only `0.55B`. Its chirp rate no
longer matches the transmitted phase history, so the terms cannot align across
the whole pulse. Both traces use the recovered peak as their 0 dB reference, so
the mismatch's peak loss remains visible while its response spreads. Restoring
`fliplr(conj(transmit_chirp))` recovers the narrow response exactly. Doppler,
clock error, waveform distortion, and calibration error can cause related
mismatch in a real radar; they are outside this delay-only lesson.

## Assumptions and limiting cases

- Echoes are integer-sample delayed, zero extended, stationary, and point-like.
  There is no circular shift or wraparound.
- The model is complex baseband with a rectangular pulse gate and constant
  amplitude. It omits RF hardware, propagation loss, clutter, Doppler, and
  detection thresholds.
- `B` remains below Nyquist. Near Nyquist the sampled chirp and its response
  become sensitive to sampling margin.
- If `B` approaches zero, the waveform becomes an unmodulated long pulse and
  compression loses its narrow peak. If `T` shrinks toward `1/B`, the energy
  advantage approaches that of a short pulse.
- Rectangular LFM has sidelobes. They are normal matched-filter structure, not
  extra targets; P33 will show how windowing trades sidelobes against width and
  gain.
- The local -3 dB width is a waveform metric, not a declaration that every
  target pair in noise is resolved.

## Common interpretation mistakes

- A long raw envelope does **not** force poor resolution when its phase carries
  large bandwidth and the receiver uses the matching replica.
- Increasing duration at fixed bandwidth raises energy and `BT`; it does not
  substantially narrow the compressed mainlobe.
- Increasing sample rate alone does not create waveform bandwidth or physical
  resolution.
- `10*log10(Fs*T)` and `10*log10(B*T)` answer different input-SNR conventions.
- `20*log10` applies to magnitude ratios; `10*log10` applies to power and SNR
  ratios.
- A mismatched filter can shift as well as broaden the largest response; its
  largest sample is not automatically the true target delay.

## Dependencies and concept connection

P31 established that waveform bandwidth controls response width independently
of estimator accuracy. P32 uses that idea inside an energetic long waveform:
correlation converts an LFM phase history into a narrow range response. The
experiment requires base MATLAB only and no toolbox. P33 builds directly on
the visible sidelobes by asking how they can hide a weaker nearby target.

Completion means you can predict how bandwidth changes compressed width and
how time-bandwidth product changes gain.

## Use the Python GUI experiment

The GUI keeps the pinned source's mental model and processing order visible. The **chirp bandwidth** control scales the primary source variable around its documented baseline; **secondary stress** isolates the next important effect; the noise control uses a fixed retained seed so reruns are comparable.

### Prediction and sweep 1 — chirp bandwidth

Hold secondary stress at 0.25 and predict the response at 0.6×, 1.0×, and 1.4× baseline. State which axis feature should move, which metric should change monotonically, and which quantity should remain invariant. Run those three cases and explain any departure using the governing equations above.

### Sweep 2 — secondary stress

Restore the primary scale to 1.0. Sweep secondary stress through 0.0, 0.5, and 1.0. Separate a genuine model change from a display-scale change, and connect the response to the source lesson's limiting cases.

### Intentionally broken case and recovery

Enable **Violate the central model assumption**. The experiment applies a deterministic ambiguity, contamination, association error, or coherent-processing error appropriate to this curriculum phase. Name the violated assumption before looking at the warning callout. Recover by disabling broken mode, returning primary scale to 1.0 and secondary stress to 0.25, and verifying that the original invariant returns.

## Common mistakes to avoid in the GUI

- Changing two controls at once and attributing the result to only one.
- Reading a smooth plotted line as information that was never measured or modeled.
- Ignoring axis units, normalization, sign, or the finite record/resource ceiling.
- Treating the broken response as random software behavior instead of a named assumption failure.
