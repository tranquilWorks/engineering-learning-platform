# Vary CFAR Guard and Training Cells

> **Guiding question:** What happens when the CFAR reference window is too small, too large, or contaminated?

## Start with the picture

CA-CFAR decides whether one cell under test (CUT) is unusually large compared
with nearby reference cells. Guards create a moat around the CUT so energy from
the same target response does not enter the background estimate. Training cells
sample the background beyond that moat. Choosing the window therefore states
three beliefs: how wide a target response can be, how many independent-looking
background samples are needed, and how far the background remains local.

For `T` training cells and `G` guard cells on each side, the stencil is

`T training | G guards | CUT | G guards | T training`.

The physical span from the first leading reference to the last lagging
reference is `(2T + 2G + 1)*Delta_R`, where `Delta_R` is the range-cell spacing.
Increasing either count also excludes `T+G` edge CUTs at each end.

## The operation exposed

Let `z[k] = |x[k]|^2` be square-law power. The two reference sets for CUT `k`
contain offsets `-(G+T):- (G+1)` and `(G+1):(G+T)`. With `N=2T`, CA-CFAR forms

`p_hat[k] = (1/N) * sum(z[i] for i in both reference sets)`

and declares a detection when

`z[k] > alpha(N,Pfa) * p_hat[k]`,

where, for independent homogeneous exponential power samples,

`alpha(N,Pfa) = N * (Pfa^(-1/N) - 1)`.

The script constructs those indices and averages their linear powers directly.
No CFAR toolbox detector hides the stencil or comparison.

## Why too few guards self-mask a target

A matched-filtered target is not confined to one cell. Its mainlobe and
sidelobes occupy neighboring cells. If `G` is narrower than that response,
target energy enters the training sum, raises `p_hat`, and raises the threshold
against the target itself. This is self-masking. In the guard sweep, zero
guards put the broad target response directly into the references; four guards
protect its central mainlobe; ten guards also move the references beyond more
sidelobes.

More guards are not free. They move the nearest background evidence farther
away, enlarge the blind edge region, and can cross a clutter change. A guard
count should cover the expected compressed-pulse response and its material
sidelobes, not merely maximize detection margin in one plot.

## Why too few training cells make a noisy threshold

Even in a constant background, each square-law noise sample fluctuates. The
average of only a few samples fluctuates strongly, so the threshold becomes
jagged from CUT to CUT. More independent homogeneous reference samples reduce
that estimator variance. The finite-`N` scale factor also changes with `N`, so
the script recomputes `alpha` for every training-cell case rather than holding
it fixed.

Do not read one seeded threshold crossing count as a measured false-alarm
probability. P52 performs the repeated homogeneous trials needed for that
claim.

## Why too many training cells stop being local

Variance is only half the problem. A large window averages background power
from a wide range span. Around the script's gradual clutter transition, that
average mixes lower-power and higher-power regions. It becomes smooth but
biased relative to the CUT's actual local mean. The training sweep therefore
shows two different metrics:

- observed threshold roughness in a nearly homogeneous region; and
- deterministic locality error obtained by applying the same stencil to the
  known mean-background curve around the transition.

The first generally falls as `T` grows. The second grows here because a wider
window straddles more of the changing background. Smooth is not synonymous
with correct.

## Contamination is a model failure, not random bad luck

CA-CFAR treats every reference cell as background. In the broken case, a strong
neighbor falls inside the weaker target's nominal training set. One large
reference power dominates the arithmetic mean and masks the weaker CUT. The
demonstration recovers by widening the guard just enough to exclude that known
neighbor, then recomputing the estimate from the original profile.

That recovery teaches geometry; it is not a universal multi-target solution.
A very wide guard can lose locality, and several unknown interferers can still
contaminate the remaining references. Ordered-statistic CFAR in P49 addresses
that failure family more directly.

## Limiting cases and common mistakes

- `G=0`: adjacent target-response energy is treated as background; this is
  valid only when the response truly occupies one cell.
- very large `G`: self-leakage falls, but references become remote and edge
  coverage shrinks.
- very small `T`: the estimate is local but high variance, and `alpha` is
  larger for the same requested `Pfa`.
- very large `T`: the estimate is smooth under homogeneous noise but can smear
  clutter transitions or include other targets.
- averaging in dB is still wrong: CA-CFAR needs an arithmetic average of linear
  power, as established in P45.
- counting all non-target threshold crossings as false alarms is unsafe near a
  deterministic sidelobe; those cells are signal-contaminated, not H0 trials.
- changing `T` without recomputing `alpha` changes the detector design as well
  as the window.

## What this experiment establishes

It establishes deterministic source-level behavior for one synthetic,
square-law, 1-D CA-CFAR scene: guards trade target protection against locality,
and training cells trade estimator variance against locality. It does not
establish performance for correlated receiver cells, measured waveforms,
unknown target extent, real clutter, hardware, or operational radar data.

## Use the Python GUI experiment

The GUI keeps the pinned source's mental model and processing order visible. The **CFAR guard width** control scales the primary source variable around its documented baseline; **secondary stress** isolates the next important effect; the noise control uses a fixed retained seed so reruns are comparable.

### Prediction and sweep 1 — CFAR guard width

Hold secondary stress at 0.25 and predict the response at 0.6×, 1.0×, and 1.4× baseline. State which axis feature should move, which metric should change monotonically, and which quantity should remain invariant. Run those three cases and explain any departure using the governing equations above.

### Sweep 2 — secondary stress

Restore the primary scale to 1.0. Sweep secondary stress through 0.0, 0.5, and 1.0. Separate a genuine model change from a display-scale change, and connect the response to the source lesson's limiting cases.

### Intentionally broken case and recovery

Enable **Violate the central model assumption**. The experiment applies a deterministic ambiguity, contamination, association error, or coherent-processing error appropriate to this curriculum phase. Name the violated assumption before looking at the warning callout. Recover by disabling broken mode, returning primary scale to 1.0 and secondary stress to 0.25, and verifying that the original invariant returns.

## Common mistakes to avoid in the GUI

- Changing two controls at once and attributing the result to only one.
- Reading a smooth plotted line as information that was never measured or modeled.
- Ignoring axis units, normalization, sign, or the finite record/resource ceiling.
- Treating the broken response as random software behavior instead of a named assumption failure.
