# Implement Conventional Delay-and-Sum Beamforming

> **Guiding question:** How does steering align one direction and misalign others?

The guiding question is: **How does steering align one direction and misalign others?**

P61 showed that direction appears as a phase slope across ULA sensors. P62
coherently added ideal element phasors to form an array factor. P63 applies the
same operation to noisy received data: each candidate direction is a spatial
template, and the conventional beamformer measures how well the array snapshot
matches that template.

## From two sources to sensor data

Let `M` sensors lie at positions `m d`, where `m=0,...,M-1`. Angle is measured
from broadside, normalized spacing is `q=d/lambda`, and the steering vector is

```text
a_m(theta) = exp(j 2 pi m q sin(theta)).
```

For two narrowband sources observed over `L` snapshots, the complex-baseband
sensor matrix is

```text
X = A_s S + N,
A_s = [a(theta_1)  a(theta_2)].
```

Each column of `X` is one simultaneous array snapshot. `S` holds the source
samples and `N` holds independent sensor noise. The reviewed SNR is nominal
per-source, per-sensor input SNR: each source has unit sample magnitude and the
complex sensor noise is scaled by `10^(-SNR/20)`.

This is the narrowband approximation. A single complex phase per channel can
represent propagation delay only when signal bandwidth is small enough that
the phase slope is effectively constant across the band. True broadband
delay-and-sum uses time delays or frequency-dependent phase; fixed phase
steering can produce beam squint.

## The conventional delay-and-sum operation

To inspect candidate direction `theta`, use a normalized fixed weight

```text
w(theta) = a(theta)/M.
```

The output for snapshot `ell` is the exposed Hermitian coherent sum

```text
y_theta[ell] = w(theta)^H x[ell]
             = (1/M) sum_m conj(a_m(theta)) x_m[ell].
```

If a source actually arrives from `theta`, `conj(a_m(theta))` removes its phase
slope. All `M` contributions have the same phase and add to unit normalized
voltage gain. For another direction `phi`, the residual contribution is

```text
(1/M) exp(j 2 pi m q [sin(phi)-sin(theta)]).
```

Those phasors rotate with element index and partially cancel. This is why a
beam is a spatial matched-filter response rather than a physical ray drawn out
of the antenna.

Figure 2 shows this operation before any repeated-case helper is used. The
matched residual phases lie on top of one another, so cumulative magnitude
grows steadily. Off-target residual phases wind, so the cumulative sum grows
and shrinks.

## Direct averaging and covariance averaging are the same scan

The conventional power estimate averages output power across snapshots:

```text
P_DAS(theta) = (1/L) sum_ell |w(theta)^H x[ell]|^2.
```

Define the sample covariance

```text
Rhat = X X^H / L.
```

Then the same quantity is

```text
P_DAS(theta) = w(theta)^H Rhat w(theta).
```

The script computes both paths and asserts agreement to numerical tolerance.
The covariance is not a new source of angular resolution; it is a compact way
to retain averaged spatial second-order information. With one snapshot,
`Rhat=x x^H` has rank one and carries every random cross-term from that look.
With many independent snapshots, source/noise cross-terms fluctuate in phase
and average toward zero, making the scan steadier.

## Sweep 1: source separation and array aperture

Two sources closer than the conventional main-lobe width need not make two
distinct peaks. The separation sweep holds array, SNR, and snapshot count fixed
while moving a symmetric pair from `6` through `12` to `24 deg`. The close
pair merges into one broad maximum; the widest pair resolves.

The array-size sub-sweep holds a `16 deg` pair, half-wavelength spacing, SNR,
and snapshots fixed while using `M=[4,8,16]`. Physical aperture is

```text
L_array = (M-1)d.
```

Four elements merge the pair. Eight and sixteen resolve it, and sixteen forms
the narrower lobes. This is the received-data version of P62's aperture result.
More snapshots cannot repair the four-element beamwidth because they estimate
the same broad fixed pattern more accurately.

## Sweep 2: SNR and snapshot reliability

At fixed geometry and `128` snapshots, the SNR sweep changes only sensor-noise
scale. Low input SNR raises the relative scan floor and can move local maxima;
high SNR exposes the two spatial responses cleanly.

At fixed data model and `0 dB` input SNR, the snapshot sweep reuses prefixes of
one deterministic 128-snapshot record. One snapshot contains strong accidental
source/source and source/noise cross-terms. Eight looks are steadier, and 128
looks reduce the reviewed off-source ripple. Snapshot averaging lowers
variance; it does not change element spacing, aperture, or theoretical
beamwidth.

## The intentionally broken case and recovery

The received model uses `a(theta)=exp(+j phase)`. The correct output contains
`a(theta)^H`, which supplies the negative compensating phase. The broken path
constructs its scan steering vector with the opposite sign and then still
takes a Hermitian transpose. It therefore tests `a(-theta)` while labeling the
axis `theta`.

For the same unchanged data and a symmetric scan grid,

```text
P_broken(theta) = P_correct(-theta).
```

Sources at `-20` and `+30 deg` appear at `+20` and `-30 deg`. The peaks are not
new arrivals, a random-noise effect, or a front/back ambiguity in this bounded
2-D model; they are an angle/phase convention error. Recovery restores
`w(theta)=a(theta)/M` and the Hermitian sum, moving both peaks back to their
true angles. The script asserts the entire broken curve equals the reversed
recovered curve, not merely that two hand-picked points look plausible.

## Limiting cases and model boundary

- One sensor has no spatial discrimination; every steering direction applies
  the same scalar magnitude.
- Co-located sensors have no direction-dependent phase slope, so coherent
  averaging improves noise but produces no angular beam.
- With infinite independent snapshots, the sample covariance approaches the
  model covariance, but finite aperture still limits conventional resolution.
- Two sources at the same direction are indistinguishable to this ULA scan.
- Half-wavelength spacing avoids the full-visible-sector spatial alias used in
  P62, but finite-aperture sidelobes remain.
- Correlated or coherent sources retain cross-terms under averaging and can
  distort conventional peaks; averaging is not guaranteed to separate them.
- A ULA measures projected direction cosine, not a unique 3-D direction.
- The simulation assumes far-field plane waves, narrowband signals,
  synchronized calibrated channels, isotropic elements, independent sources,
  spatially white noise, and no coupling or multipath.

P65 will make weights depend on `Rhat` to suppress interference, P66 will use
signal/noise subspaces, and P67 will show how channel error breaks the ideal
steering match.

## Common interpretation mistakes

- Saying the beamformer delays this narrowband complex record in seconds hides
  that it applies a carrier-phase compensation here.
- Omitting the conjugate from `w^H x` doubles or reverses the phase slope rather
  than removing it.
- Calling a single-snapshot curve a stable spectrum ignores its random
  cross-terms.
- Saying covariance averaging narrows the main lobe confuses variance with
  aperture resolution.
- Normalizing each curve and then claiming absolute output power is unchanged
  confuses display normalization with physical power.
- Treating a merged close pair as one proven source mistakes conventional
  resolution for scene truth.
- Calling the largest two samples the source angles can select samples from
  one broad lobe; distinct local peaks and the array resolution must be checked.
- Claiming two clean simulated peaks validate an antenna ignores element
  pattern, calibration, coupling, bandwidth, multipath, and hardware.

## Dependencies, compatibility, and claim boundary

P61 and P62 are the concept and ordering prerequisites. The experiment uses
base MATLAB, explicit matrix products, bounded loops, and private Park-Miller
and Box-Muller generators that do not alter global random state. It needs
script-local functions (MATLAB R2016b or newer), writes no file, and starts no
network, timer, worker, or checkpoint. Static source checks and an independent
Python simulation do not prove MATLAB parsing/execution, rendered plots,
educational effectiveness, antenna performance, hardware/HIL, real-time,
field, deployment, or production behavior.

## Use the Python GUI experiment

The GUI keeps the pinned source's mental model and processing order visible. The **steering angle** control scales the primary source variable around its documented baseline; **secondary stress** isolates the next important effect; the noise control uses a fixed retained seed so reruns are comparable.

### Prediction and sweep 1 — steering angle

Hold secondary stress at 0.25 and predict the response at 0.6×, 1.0×, and 1.4× baseline. State which axis feature should move, which metric should change monotonically, and which quantity should remain invariant. Run those three cases and explain any departure using the governing equations above.

### Sweep 2 — secondary stress

Restore the primary scale to 1.0. Sweep secondary stress through 0.0, 0.5, and 1.0. Separate a genuine model change from a display-scale change, and connect the response to the source lesson's limiting cases.

### Intentionally broken case and recovery

Enable **Violate the central model assumption**. The experiment applies a deterministic ambiguity, contamination, association error, or coherent-processing error appropriate to this curriculum phase. Name the violated assumption before looking at the warning callout. Recover by disabling broken mode, returning primary scale to 1.0 and secondary stress to 0.25, and verifying that the original invariant returns.

## Common mistakes to avoid in the GUI

- Changing two controls at once and attributing the result to only one.
- Reading a smooth plotted line as information that was never measured or modeled.
- Ignoring axis units, normalization, sign, or the finite record/resource ceiling.
- Treating the broken response as random software behavior instead of a named assumption failure.
