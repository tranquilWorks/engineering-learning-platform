# Lesson: the product before azimuth focusing

## Guiding question

**What information is created before azimuth focusing begins?**

Range compression produces a complex matrix whose rows are aperture positions
and whose columns are slant-range samples. A point target becomes a narrow
range ridge, but its complex value still rotates along the aperture according
to path length. That matrix is a **range-compressed phase history**, not yet a
SAR image.

## Start with the physical signal

At platform position `x_p`, target `k` has slant range

```text
R_k(x_p) = sqrt(y_k^2 + (x_p - x_k)^2).
```

The module inserts one sampled LFM waveform `s[n]` at the corresponding
monostatic delay and gives it the narrowband two-way carrier phase

```text
d_k(x_p) = round((R_k(x_p) - R_gate) / Delta_R_sample)
phi_k(x_p) = phi_0,k - 4*pi*(R_k(x_p) - y_k)/lambda
x[p,n] = sum_k A_k s[n-d_k(x_p)] exp(j phi_k(x_p)) + w[p,n].
```

Here `Delta_R_sample = c/(2 Fs)`. Subtracting `y_k` from the phase removes one
target-constant rotation; it does not remove the phase variation across the
aperture. The `4*pi/lambda` factor is the monostatic round trip. The script
does not also encode carrier delay inside the baseband chirp, so carrier phase
is not counted twice.

## What range compression does

For every aperture row independently, the matched replica is

```text
h[n] = conj(s[N-1-n])
y[p,m] = sum_n x[p,n] h[m-n] / sum_n |s[n]|^2.
```

This is an explicit linear convolution, not a circular correlation or an
opaque toolbox object. The energy normalization keeps a single isolated
target's compressed peak in voltage units. Linear convolution adds `N-1`
samples of filter delay, which the displayed range axis explicitly removes.

The operation aligns the chirp samples from one delay. A long echo therefore
becomes a localized response. Its approximate range-resolution scale is

```text
Delta_R_resolution approximately c/(2B).
```

Do not confuse this with `c/(2 Fs)`: sample rate sets the displayed range-grid
spacing, while waveform bandwidth sets the physical ability to separate close
delays. The baseline has a 1.25 m grid and a 7.5 m nominal resolution scale.

## What survives compression

The matched filter acts down fast time and does not combine aperture rows.
Consequently, the target's complex peak is approximately

```text
y[p, target ridge] approximately A_k exp(j phi_k(x_p)) + filtered noise.
```

Two kinds of information coexist:

- ridge location gives sampled slant range at each aperture position;
- complex ridge phase records coherent path change across positions.

P77 can later test a cross-range hypothesis by compensating that phase and
adding aperture looks. A bright magnitude ridge alone cannot support that
coherent sum. P76 therefore measures agreement between the observed ridge
phasor and the expected two-way path phasor.

## Read the three cause-and-effect experiments

The bandwidth sweep holds duration, isolated-target delay, sample rate, and
all other scene assumptions fixed. Raising `B` from 10 to 40 MHz makes the
full -3 dB response width decrease and makes `c/(2B)` decrease. Pulse duration
stays fixed, so this is a bandwidth effect.

The spacing sweep holds the 20 MHz waveform and equal target amplitudes fixed.
At 3.75 m and 10 m, the pair does not create a valley below the weaker peak's
-3 dB level. At 15 m, the reviewed pair is separated. This is a resolution
statement, not an accuracy statement and not an azimuth result.

The broken case copies `abs(Y)`. Its magnitude map is exactly the same as the
complex map's magnitude, so all visible range ridges survive. But every
nonnegative sample has zero phase, destroying agreement with the expected
aperture phase. Recovery points back to the unchanged complex matrix and must
match it exactly.

## Limiting cases and model boundary

- As `B` decreases toward zero, compressed responses broaden and nearby
  targets merge even if the range grid is dense.
- Increasing `Fs` at fixed `B` samples the same physical response more finely;
  it does not by itself create finer range resolution.
- If target separation is far below `c/(2B)`, two returns behave like one
  composite response. Near the limit, phase and amplitude can change the exact
  valley, so the script binds only its reviewed equal-phase case.
- If aperture length shrinks to one position, range compression still works,
  but there is no aperture phase history available for cross-range focus.
- If complex phase is discarded, range localization survives and coherent
  azimuth focusing does not.
- If platform spacing is too large, adjacent phase changes can exceed `pi`
  radians and spatially alias. The reviewed limit is `0.90*pi`.
- Integer delays can differ from true slant range by half a range sample. This
  experiment keeps that quantization visible rather than claiming sub-sample
  accuracy.
- Rectangular LFM weighting produces sidelobes. They are responses of the
  waveform, not additional physical targets.
- Stop-and-go motion, stationary isotropic point targets, exact platform
  positions, narrowband carrier phase, no within-pulse Doppler, no clutter,
  and no propagation loss are assumptions. P78 owns range-cell migration,
  P79 owns SAR window/resolution tradeoffs, and P80 owns motion error.

## Dependencies and runtime boundary

P18 provides complex phase, P30 provides round-trip delay, P32 provides LFM
matched filtering, P37 provides radar-matrix orientation, and governed P75
provides SAR phase-history intuition. The experiment targets base MATLAB
R2016b or newer with no optional toolbox. Static checks and independent Python
oracles are not MATLAB runtime or rendered-figure evidence.

## Interactive lab: Perform SAR Range Compression

**Guiding question:** What information is created before azimuth focusing begins?

Seed 7601; carrier 5 GHz, fs 120 MHz, 2 us pulse, 20 MHz baseline bandwidth. A 361-sample 950:1.25:1400 m gate spans 401 aperture positions. Targets cross-range-15/0/18 m and perpendicular 1000/1025/1070 m use voltages 1/.8/.6 and phases 0/.6/-.9, noise RMS.2. Round-to-nearest delays insert 240 sample chirps; zero-padded 1024 FFT linear convolution returns 600 samples normalized by 240. The range axis subtracts 239 samples. Separate noiseless isolated bandwidth 10/20/40 MHz and equal-target spacing 3.75/10/15 m examples show resolution.

### Predict, sweep, explain

Predict which dimension range compression transforms and why the filter delay must be removed from the range axis. Why does narrowing a range response leave azimuth unfocused, and why must complex phase survive?

1. Start at the baseline. Sweep only **Bandwidth mhz** from 20 to 40 MHz. Predict, run, and explain a measured value using the governing equation; then reset.
2. Start at the baseline. Sweep only **Pair spacing m** from 10 to 15 m. Predict, run, and explain a measured value using the governing equation; then reset.
3. Enable the broken case. Magnitude-only range history retains identical range ridges but replaces each aperture phase by zero, destroying later coherent azimuth processing.
4. Recovery: Recover the retained original complex range-compressed record; lost phase cannot be reconstructed from magnitude. This lesson performs range compression only, not azimuth focusing.

### Focused check and teach-back

Predict which dimension range compression transforms and why the filter delay must be removed from the range axis. Why does narrowing a range response leave azimuth unfocused, and why must complex phase survive? Support the explanation with a measured value and units, and state the recovery assumption.

### Common mistakes

Magnitude-only range history retains identical range ridges but replaces each aperture phase by zero, destroying later coherent azimuth processing. Distinguish the selected-control scene from a named separate failure scene.

### Scope of this lab

The pinned source lesson is preserved above. Private Park–Miller uniforms retain zero offset; P65–P72 split radius/phase uniform blocks and P73–P76 interleave them. Matrix inputs retain column-major ordering. P75 shorter apertures crop the full baseline noise record to isolate aperture changes. MUSIC missing-peak penalties and truth-defined audit neighborhoods are disclosed; neither manufactures successful detections. Source figures become labeled native plots; full arrays drive calculations before display decimation. Sixty independent software comparisons cover five scenarios per lesson. No MATLAB execution, browser/accessibility, learner, hardware or production validation is claimed.
