# P84 lesson: the seams are the system

## Guiding question

Can I trace a target from waveform generation through detection and tracking without treating any stage as a black box?

The useful mental model is a chain of evidence. Each stage changes the form of
the information, but it cannot invent information discarded upstream. A bright
track is not proof that the waveform resolved two targets, and an empty CFAR
mask does not tell you whether the echo was absent, smeared by a wrong matched
filter, hidden by clutter, or rejected by the threshold.

## 1. Waveform and scene

The transmitted complex-baseband LFM pulse is

\[
s(t)=\exp\{j\pi (B/T)t^2\},\qquad |t|<T/2.
\]

Its instantaneous frequency is `(B/T)t`. A point target at range `R` produces
round-trip delay `tau=2R/c`; approach speed `v` produces
`f_D=2v/lambda`. In the experiment, positive velocity means approaching, so
its range evolves as `R(k)=R(0)-v k T_scan` even though its slow-time phase
rotates in the positive Doppler direction.

The nominal range resolution `c/(2B)` is different from range sample spacing
`c/(2fs)`. Sampling can put many display points across a response without
making two objects physically resolvable. Doppler-bin spacing is

\[
\Delta v=\frac{\lambda\,PRF}{2N_p}.
\]

The scene includes a stationary target, a moving target, a strong/weak pair at
the same Doppler, a step in stationary clutter power, and an echo-like receiver
spur with no target truth. The moving echo is faded before reception on scan 4;
the later coast is therefore a consequence of the scene, not a deleted report.

## 2. Receiver imperfection and calibration

Let `y=x+n` be the scene voltage plus receiver noise. The measured complex
sample is

\[
z=y+\epsilon y^*+d.
\]

The conjugate term creates an image; `d` creates center leakage. Because this
teaching model makes `epsilon` and `d` visible, calibration is the explicit
inverse

\[
\hat{y}=\frac{(z-d)-\epsilon(z-d)^*}{1-\epsilon^2}.
\]

Calibration removes the modeled image/DC terms, not the additive noise already
inside `y`. As `epsilon` tends to zero, the image disappears. When its magnitude approaches
one, the inverse becomes ill-conditioned; the controls reject that limit.

## 3. Pulse compression and range-Doppler processing

The matched-filter impulse response is not merely the waveform played
backward. It is the conjugate time reverse:

\[
h[m]=s^*[N_s-1-m].
\]

The script performs full linear convolution and removes exactly the known
filter delay. It then applies an explicit cosine slow-time window and computes
an FFT across pulse columns—not across range rows. The signed velocity axis
comes from the FFT frequency axis through `v=lambda f_D/2`.

With few pulses, velocity bins are coarse. At `|v| >= lambda PRF/4`, Doppler
aliases. A stationary target lies on the zero-Doppler clutter ridge, so
waveform energy alone does not guarantee separability.

## 4. Threshold, cluster, and score

For a rectangular 2-D CA-CFAR stencil with `N` training cells, the homogeneous
exponential-noise scale is

\[
\alpha=N(P_{fa}^{-1/N}-1),\qquad T=\alpha\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N P_i.
\]

All averaging is in linear power. Range and Doppler border cells without a full
stencil are ineligible; they are not padded with zeros. This `Pfa` is a design
value for independent homogeneous exponential cells. Matched-filter
correlation, windowing, target sidelobes, and the clutter edge violate that
model, so the experiment labels its measured ratio an empirical false-cell
rate rather than proof that the requested `Pfa` was achieved.

One target response may cross threshold in several cells. An explicit
8-connected search groups those cells and uses positive threshold excess as a
centroid weight. One report can match at most one truth object. That rule is
essential beside the strong/weak pair: one merged component is not two
detections. The scorer retains all feasible truth/report assignment masks and
uses the maximum-cardinality one-to-one result, so `Pd` and false-report counts
do not depend on the order of truth entries.

## 5. Tracking is prediction plus accountable correction

The tracker state is range and range rate. It predicts
`R^- = R + Rdot*Tscan`, gates reports in range and measured Doppler, then uses
the same innovation to correct position and rate:

\[
R^+=R^-+\alpha e,\qquad \dot R^+=\dot R^-+(\beta/T)e.
\]

No accepted report means predict and coast, not silently reuse the previous
measurement. Truth enters only afterward to compute range RMSE. The declared
initial surveillance sector and positive-Doppler rule initiate the track
without consulting truth.

## Two controlled sweeps

1. The taper sweep blends rectangular and cosine matched replicas while
   retaining the same calibrated receiver record. Strong-target sidelobes can
   fall, but the mainlobe broadens and coherent gain changes; weak-neighbor
   visibility need not improve monotonically.
2. The `Pfa` sweep reuses one range-Doppler power map. Increasing requested
   `Pfa` lowers `alpha`, so threshold crossings can only be added. More reports
   may raise `Pd`, but false cells and false reports can also increase.

## Broken path and limiting cases

The broken matched filter reverses the LFM without conjugating it. Energy no
longer adds with the intended phase, so compression gain and downstream
detections change. Recovery uses the retained calibrated cube and the correct
replica; equality with the baseline is checked cell for cell.

Other useful limits:

- `B -> 0`: nominal range resolution becomes arbitrarily poor.
- target spacing below the compressed mainlobe: clustering can merge objects.
- smaller requested `Pfa`: the CFAR multiplier rises and weak targets are lost.
- guards narrower than a response: target energy contaminates its own training.
- `v=0`: target Doppler overlaps stationary clutter.
- no report: a bounded coast propagates state but adds no new evidence.
- wrong velocity sign: an approaching-target prediction walks away in range.

The experiment is deterministic synthetic analysis, not an operational radar
claim. Static repository checks cannot prove MATLAB execution, numerical
fidelity, figure rendering, real-time behavior, or educational effectiveness.

## Interactive lab: Run the End-to-End Radar Processing Capstone

**Guiding question:** Can I trace a target from waveform generation through detection and tracking without treating any stage as a black box?

Seed family 8401: fixed clutter uses 8411 and scan noise uses 8501 + scan. The 10 GHz radar uses a unit-energy 32-sample LFM at 4 MHz, duration 8 us and bandwidth 2 MHz; each scan has 128 fast samples by 32 pulses. Four targets, a clutter edge and a receiver spur enter the retained cube. Invert the known DC/IQ image model, apply the conjugate time-reversed replica with exact 31-sample delay removal, then Hann Doppler processing. CA-CFAR uses a complete 13 by 9 stencil minus 5 by 3 guard/CUT cells, leaving 102 training cells; border cells are ineligible. Eight-connected excess-weighted reports feed gated alpha-beta tracking. Maximum one-to-one truth matching is offline scoring only. Controls and failure compare the retained first scan. As in the source, the explicitly labeled eight-scan tracking sequence always retains Pfa=0.001, taper=0 and the correct replica; scan 4 physically fades the moving target before reception. Requested Pfa is not the empirical false-cell rate in this correlated scene.

### Predict, sweep, explain

Predict how replica taper and requested Pfa change compression, crossings and reports. Trace a target through every processing stage, and explain why the physically faded scan causes a coast rather than an invented measurement.

1. Start at the baseline. Sweep only **Design pfa** from 0.001 to 0.01 ratio. Predict, run, and explain a measured value using the governing equation; then reset.
2. Start at the baseline. Sweep only **Replica taper** from 0 to 1 ratio. Predict, run, and explain a measured value using the governing equation; then reset.
3. Enable the broken case. Removing conjugation from the matched replica loses coherent compression gain and changes downstream detections. A fixed threshold also overreacts to the clutter edge; a report near the injected receiver spur is a false report, not target truth.
4. Recovery: Disable the failure to rerun the conjugate time-reversed replica on the identical calibrated cube. Reports drive tracking; truth is used only for offline scoring. Requested Pfa is not a guarantee for these correlated, nonhomogeneous cells.

### Focused check and teach-back

Predict how replica taper and requested Pfa change compression, crossings and reports. Trace a target through every processing stage, and explain why the physically faded scan causes a coast rather than an invented measurement. Support the explanation with a measured value and units, and state the recovery assumption.

### Common mistakes

Removing conjugation from the matched replica loses coherent compression gain and changes downstream detections. A fixed threshold also overreacts to the clutter edge; a report near the injected receiver spur is a false report, not target truth. Distinguish the selected-control scene from a named separate failure scene.

### Scope of this lab

The pinned source lesson is preserved above. Private Park–Miller inputs preserve the source zero-offset uniforms except P79/P80, which retain half-offset uniforms. P77/P78 interleave Box–Muller inputs; P81 uses direct phase uniforms and P83/P84 split radius/phase blocks. Matrix inputs retain column-major ordering. Complex interpolation requires a complete adjacent pair, so the last unsupported endpoint is zero. Full calculations precede display decimation. Forty independent software comparisons cover five scenarios per lesson. No MATLAB execution, browser/accessibility, learner, hardware or production validation is claimed.
