# P75 Lesson: Build SAR Phase-History Intuition

## Guiding question

Why does moving one antenna create a large synthetic aperture?

## One antenna, many spatial samples

Imagine stopping one coherent radar at a sequence of surveyed positions along
a straight line. At every stop it transmits, receives the echo, and preserves
complex I/Q. Those looks were made by one antenna, but they sample the wavefield
across the full track. SAR processing treats the ordered positions as one
synthetic aperture only because their geometry and relative phase remain known.

For platform cross-range position `x_p`, target cross-range `x_t`, and closest
slant range `R_0`, the point-target range is

```text
R(x_p) = sqrt(R_0^2 + (x_p - x_t)^2).
```

The echo's two-way delay and carrier phase are

```text
tau(x_p) = 2 R(x_p) / c,
phi(x_p) = -2 pi f_c tau(x_p) = -4 pi R(x_p) / lambda.
```

The factor of two is the outbound-plus-return path. A range change of only
`lambda/2` therefore turns the complex echo through a full cycle. The script
subtracts one constant reference range before evaluating the phasor; that
rotates every sample by the same constant and leaves all spatial information
unchanged.

## What the raw phase history contains

At each position, the ideal complex fast-time record is modeled as

```text
s(x_p, r) = a(r - R(x_p)) exp(-j 4 pi [R(x_p)-R_ref] / lambda) + n(x_p, r),
```

where `a` is a visible Gaussian range envelope and `n` is seeded complex noise.
The envelope says where the echo arrives in fast time. The complex exponential
says how the carrier phase changes across the aperture. No toolbox simulator or
focuser hides either operation.

Near closest approach, let `u = x_p-x_t` and assume `|u| << R_0`. Then

```text
R(x_p) approximately R_0 + u^2/(2 R_0),
phi_relative(x_p) approximately -2 pi u^2/(lambda R_0).
```

That quadratic term is the visible phase curvature. Its vertex occurs at
`x_p = x_t`. Two targets with the same closest range but different cross-range
coordinates therefore have phase histories with the same basic shape shifted
to different platform positions. That is the key completion idea.

## Why a longer track helps

A short aperture sees only a small arc of the range curve. A longer aperture
observes a larger angular span and more two-way phase turns. In this baseline,
20, 40, and 80 m apertures reveal progressively more of the same curved history
while carrier, target, spatial spacing, and noise model remain fixed. Merely
extending the interval does not change the closest-approach local curvature
`-4*pi/(lambda*R_0)`.

More phase turns are not automatically useful. The spatial samples must be
dense enough that adjacent phase change does not alias, the platform positions
must be known, and the oscillator must stay coherent. The experiment rejects a
reviewed geometry if its largest adjacent phase step reaches `pi` radians.
P79 later treats resolution and aperture/window tradeoffs more fully.

## Coherent path matching

For a candidate target coordinate `x_h`, the script builds the expected unit
phasor `h(x_p; x_h)` from the same range equation and computes

```text
score(x_h) = abs(sum(s_phase(x_p) conj(h(x_p; x_h))))
             / sum(abs(s_phase(x_p))).
```

The L1 magnitude normalizer keeps the score between zero and one when selected
noisy ridge samples have slightly unequal magnitude. This is a transparent
one-dimensional coherent sum, not a black-box SAR image.
When the hypothesized path matches the measured path, conjugate phases cancel
and the terms add in phase. A wrong path leaves residual rotation and partial
cancellation. P77 generalizes this idea into backprojection over image pixels.

## The intentionally broken case

Taking `abs` of each complex aperture sample preserves echo strength but erases
the sign and amount of phase rotation. The magnitude-only record can no longer
distinguish the curved histories. Its best coherent score is small even though
the target is still visibly present in fast time.

Recovery does not invent a correction from magnitudes. It returns to an
unchanged copy of the original complex record and applies the same explicit
path-matched sum. Once phase has truly been discarded in acquisition, it
cannot be reconstructed from magnitude alone.

## Limiting cases and interpretation traps

- **Zero aperture:** repeated looks from one position add SNR but provide no
  cross-range phase history.
- **Target at track center:** the range and relative phase curves are symmetric;
  symmetry does not mean phase is constant.
- **Target shifted in cross-range:** the phase-history vertex shifts with it;
  target range has not necessarily changed.
- **Very distant target or very short aperture:** curvature becomes weak because
  the same lateral displacement changes slant range less.
- **Lower carrier frequency:** wavelength grows, so the same path change creates
  fewer phase turns.
- **Sparse spatial sampling:** wrapped phase may alias even when every individual
  sample is measured perfectly.
- **Magnitude-only data:** the range envelope survives, but coherent cross-range
  discrimination does not.
- **Unknown motion or oscillator phase:** position/phase errors corrupt the path
  match; P80 treats motion error and autofocus.
- **Long aperture:** range migration eventually matters. This module keeps it
  visible but small; P78 treats correction explicitly.
- **Point-target model:** terrain, antenna pattern, reflectivity variation,
  propagation, squint, Earth curvature, and full imaging are outside this slice.

## Dependencies and compatibility

P18 provides I/Q phase, P30 provides two-way delay, P36 provides coherent
phase progression, and P61-P63 provide spatial aperture and steering intuition.
P74 is the ordered prerequisite. The script targets base MATLAB R2016b or newer,
uses a private Park-Miller/Box-Muller noise stream, performs no file/network
I/O, creates five tagged figure groups, caps live storage at 4,000,000
eight-byte value equivalents, and requires no optional toolbox.

## Completion connection

You are ready to continue when you can say: two equal-closest-range targets at
different cross-range coordinates create different aperture-phase histories
because each target's path-length minimum—and therefore its phase-curvature
vertex—occurs at a different platform position.

## Interactive lab: Build SAR Phase-History Intuition

**Guiding question:** Why does moving one antenna create a large synthetic aperture?

Seed 7501; carrier 5 GHz, 1000 m closest range, 80 m aperture sampled every.2 m, 995:.05:1005 m fast range, Gaussian envelope sigma.6 m, 30 dB. Relative phase=-4 pi(R-1000)/.06; baseline excursion.7996802557 m and 26.65600852 turns. Cross-range-20/0/20 m and aperture 20/40/80 m controls reuse a full 401 x 201 noise record cropped at shorter apertures. Coherent scores scan-26:.25:26 m along the sampled delay ridge.

### Predict, sweep, explain

Predict how cross-range position moves the slant-range vertex and how aperture length changes phase span. Why does a magnitude ridge fail to focus under the correct path-phase hypothesis?

1. Start at the baseline. Sweep only **Target cross range m** from 0 to 20 m. Predict, run, and explain a measured value using the governing equation; then reset.
2. Start at the baseline. Sweep only **Aperture length m** from 80 to 20 m. Predict, run, and explain a measured value using the governing equation; then reset.
3. Enable the broken case. Taking magnitude preserves the delay ridge but erases aperture phase, so correct path compensation cannot align the data.
4. Recovery: Return to the unchanged complex ridge samples. Controls crop a fixed401x201 noise record when aperture changes, preserving nested measurements rather than regenerating noise.

### Focused check and teach-back

Predict how cross-range position moves the slant-range vertex and how aperture length changes phase span. Why does a magnitude ridge fail to focus under the correct path-phase hypothesis? Support the explanation with a measured value and units, and state the recovery assumption.

### Common mistakes

Taking magnitude preserves the delay ridge but erases aperture phase, so correct path compensation cannot align the data. Distinguish the selected-control scene from a named separate failure scene.

### Scope of this lab

The pinned source lesson is preserved above. Private Park–Miller uniforms retain zero offset; P65–P72 split radius/phase uniform blocks and P73–P76 interleave them. Matrix inputs retain column-major ordering. P75 shorter apertures crop the full baseline noise record to isolate aperture changes. MUSIC missing-peak penalties and truth-defined audit neighborhoods are disclosed; neither manufactures successful detections. Source figures become labeled native plots; full arrays drive calculations before display decimation. Sixty independent software comparisons cover five scenarios per lesson. No MATLAB execution, browser/accessibility, learner, hardware or production validation is claimed.
