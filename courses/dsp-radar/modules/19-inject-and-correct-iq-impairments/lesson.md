# Inject and Correct IQ Impairments

> **Guiding question:** How do DC offset, gain mismatch, and quadrature error change an IQ spectrum?

## Guiding question

How do DC offset, gain mismatch, and quadrature error change an IQ spectrum?

## Physical mental model

P18 treated I and Q as the horizontal and vertical coordinates of a rotating
arrow. An ideal receiver measures those coordinates with the same scale, a
90-degree relationship, and an origin at zero. A direct-conversion receiver
can miss all three conditions:

- DC offset moves the origin, so the whole I/Q trajectory shifts.
- Unequal branch gains stretch one axis more than the other, turning a circle
  into an axis-aligned ellipse.
- Quadrature phase error mixes part of I into Q, tilting or shearing that
  ellipse.

Those geometry changes have spectral signatures. The offset creates a spike at
zero frequency. Either kind of I/Q imbalance creates a conjugate image of a
positive-frequency tone at the corresponding negative frequency.

## The explicit receiver model

Let the ideal complex tone be

\[
z[n]=I[n]+jQ[n]=A e^{j\theta[n]},\qquad
\theta[n]=2\pi f_0 n/f_s+\theta_0.
\]

The experiment uses the memoryless receiver model

\[
I_r[n]=g_I I[n]+d_I,
\]

\[
Q_r[n]=g_Q\big(Q[n]\cos\phi+I[n]\sin\phi\big)+d_Q.
\]

Here `dI,dQ` are offsets in volts, `gI,gQ` are dimensionless branch gains, and
`phi` is quadrature error. The sign of `phi` depends on the receiver's phase
convention; its magnitude controls the leakage in this model.

After removing DC, the impaired tone can be written as

\[
z_r[n]=\alpha e^{j\theta[n]}+\beta e^{-j\theta[n]},
\]

with

\[
\alpha={g_I+g_Qe^{j\phi}\over 2},\qquad
\beta={g_I-g_Qe^{-j\phi}\over 2}.
\]

`alpha` multiplies the desired `+f0` rotation. `beta` multiplies a new `-f0`
image. Image-rejection ratio is therefore

\[
\mathrm{IRR}=20\log_{10}{|\alpha|\over|\beta|}\ \mathrm{dB}.
\]

The script computes the same quantities transparently by projecting samples
onto `exp(+j*theta)` and `exp(-j*theta)`. The centered FFT supplies the picture;
the coherent projections supply the labeled desired/image metrics.

## What each isolated impairment does

DC alone changes `mean(z)` but does not create a deterministic conjugate image.
Its zero-frequency spike relative to the desired tone is

\[
20\log_{10}{|d_I+jd_Q|\over|\alpha|}\ \mathrm{dBc}.
\]

With gain mismatch alone (`phi=0`),

\[
\mathrm{IRR}={g_I+g_Q\over|g_I-g_Q|}
\]

before conversion to decibels. With equal gains and phase error alone,

\[
\mathrm{IRR}=\cot(|\phi|/2).
\]

Both imbalance mechanisms make an image, but their I/Q geometry differs:
gain mismatch changes the axis lengths while phase error creates nonzero I/Q
correlation.

## Why correction is staged

First estimate and subtract the mean:

\[
\hat d=\operatorname{mean}(z_r),\qquad z_0=z_r-\hat d.
\]

For a full-cycle circular calibration tone, each ideal branch has RMS
`A/sqrt(2)`. Estimate the two gains from branch RMS and divide them out:

\[
\hat g_I={\sqrt{2E[I_0^2]}\over A},\qquad
\hat g_Q={\sqrt{2E[Q_0^2]}\over A}.
\]

After gain normalization, the normalized cross-correlation is

\[
\rho={2E[I_gQ_g]\over A^2}=\sin\phi,
\qquad \hat\phi=\sin^{-1}(\rho).
\]

The correction must undo the quadrature shear:

\[
Q_c={Q_g-I_g\sin\hat\phi\over\cos\hat\phi},
\qquad z_c=I_g+jQ_c.
\]

Order matters. Removing the center first prevents offsets from contaminating
RMS and covariance. Normalizing branch scales next makes the cross-correlation
an estimate of phase error rather than a mixture of phase and gain effects.

## The two sweeps

The I-gain sweep holds Q gain at one, keeps the 1 V tone fixed, and holds DC,
quadrature error, and noise at zero. Increasing `gI` from 1 to 1.30 stretches
the horizontal axis and lowers image rejection monotonically.

The quadrature-error sweep holds both gains at one and holds DC, tone, and
noise fixed. Increasing error from 0 to 15 degrees increases I/Q correlation,
tilts the trajectory, and raises the negative-frequency image. Each sweep
changes one receiver mechanism.

## The deliberately broken case

A tempting repair is to rotate the whole gain-corrected complex stream by
`exp(-j*phiHat)`. That changes the phases of both desired and image components
but not either magnitude, so IRR is unchanged. A global rotation can repair a
common carrier phase; it cannot undo nonorthogonal I/Q axes. The shear inverse
above removes the I leakage from Q and improves IRR.

## Limiting cases

- With zero offset, equal gains, and zero phase error, the ideal image is zero;
  finite noise and arithmetic set the reported floor.
- DC removal cannot distinguish receiver offset from a real desired signal at
  zero frequency. A calibration assumption or separate reference is required.
- If the calibration record does not span balanced/full-cycle excitation,
  signal mean and covariance can masquerade as impairment.
- As `|phi|` approaches 90 degrees, `cos(phi)` approaches zero and the shear
  inverse becomes singular and noise-sensitive. This lesson deliberately
  constrains the model to `|phi|<45 degrees`.
- The `asin` estimator assumes the small-error branch. It cannot identify the
  correct quadrant for arbitrary phase errors.
- Dynamic, frequency-selective, nonlinear, clipping, timing-skew, and LO
  leakage mechanisms require richer receiver models than this static lesson.
- A stationary QPSK cloud would need symbol-aware interpretation. This module
  uses a rotating calibration tone, so the plotted curve is an I/Q trajectory,
  not a symbol constellation.

## Radar connection

In a homodyne radar receiver, DC leakage can cover zero-Doppler returns, while
gain and quadrature imbalance mirror a strong positive-Doppler or beat-frequency
component into the negative side. That false image can resemble a target in a
signed spectrum or range-Doppler map. Calibration improves the digital sample
stream, but it does not prove that every center spike or mirrored return in
operational data is receiver impairment.

## Common interpretation mistakes

- Calling every center bin a target or every image a second physical source.
- Treating DC subtraction as safe when a desired baseband signal can truly sit
  at DC.
- Using a global complex rotation to repair quadrature-axis nonorthogonality.
- Estimating phase before centering and gain-normalizing the branches.
- Calling an I/Q trajectory a QPSK constellation.
- Reporting a high ideal IRR without naming the noise and numerical floor.
- Assuming one calibration tone covers frequency-dependent hardware behavior.

## Dependencies and execution boundary

P18 is the immediate prerequisite: it establishes signed complex spectra,
conjugate images, and the information carried jointly by I and Q. P11 supplies
the centered FFT-frequency map.

The script uses base MATLAB, a private seed, one 4096-sample record, two fixed
three-case sweeps, and six P19-tagged figure groups. It performs no file,
network, audio, timer, parallel, or background work. Ctrl+C cancels only the
foreground run. Static Python validation does not prove MATLAB execution,
rendered plots, hardware behavior, or educational effectiveness.

## Use the Python GUI experiment

The GUI keeps the pinned source's mental model and processing order visible. The **IQ gain mismatch** control scales the primary source variable around its documented baseline; **secondary stress** isolates the next important effect; the noise control uses a fixed retained seed so reruns are comparable.

### Prediction and sweep 1 — IQ gain mismatch

Hold secondary stress at 0.25 and predict the response at 0.6×, 1.0×, and 1.4× baseline. State which axis feature should move, which metric should change monotonically, and which quantity should remain invariant. Run those three cases and explain any departure using the governing equations above.

### Sweep 2 — secondary stress

Restore the primary scale to 1.0. Sweep secondary stress through 0.0, 0.5, and 1.0. Separate a genuine model change from a display-scale change, and connect the response to the source lesson's limiting cases.

### Intentionally broken case and recovery

Enable **Violate the central model assumption**. The experiment applies a deterministic ambiguity, contamination, association error, or coherent-processing error appropriate to this curriculum phase. Name the violated assumption before looking at the warning callout. Recover by disabling broken mode, returning primary scale to 1.0 and secondary stress to 0.25, and verifying that the original invariant returns.

## Common mistakes to avoid in the GUI

- Changing two controls at once and attributing the result to only one.
- Reading a smooth plotted line as information that was never measured or modeled.
- Ignoring axis units, normalization, sign, or the finite record/resource ceiling.
- Treating the broken response as random software behavior instead of a named assumption failure.
