# Prove Zero-Padding Does Not Improve True Resolution

## Guiding question

Why does a smoother FFT plot not necessarily contain more information?

## Physical mental model

Imagine taking 128 measurements, placing them on a table, and then inserting
blank cards after the last measurement. The extra cards let you draw a smoother
curve through the spectral values, but they contain no new measurements. A
longer observation is different: it places more cards containing actual signal
values on the table. Those later samples reveal more relative phase evolution
between nearby tones.

In a radar range or Doppler FFT, zero-padding is a finer display ruler. More
waveform bandwidth or coherent observation time changes the physical response;
more zeros do not.

## One finite record, many display grids

For measured samples `x[n]`, `0 <= n < N`, the finite-record transform at any
frequency is

\[
X(f)=\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}x[n]e^{-j2\pi fn/f_s}.
\]

An `N_fft`-point FFT samples this same expression at

\[
f_k=k\frac{f_s}{N_{\mathrm{fft}}}.
\]

When `N_fft > N`, MATLAB appends zeros before evaluating those additional
frequency points. The display spacing is `f_s/N_fft`, but the independent
sample count remains `N` and the observed duration remains `T=N/f_s`.
Every original `N`-point DFT value is still present at every padding factor;
the padded FFT only inserts evaluations between them.

The experiment checks one dense-grid value with the explicit sum above before
using `fft`, and checks that the 1x DFT bins are identical inside every padded
spectrum.

## Resolution comes from observation time

For a rectangular observation, one tone has its first spectral nulls about
`1/T` hertz to either side of its frequency. The null-to-null main-lobe width
is therefore about

\[
B_{\mathrm{main}}=\frac{2}{T}=\frac{2f_s}{N}.
\]

The Rayleigh interval `1/T = f_s/N` is a useful resolution scale. It depends on
the number of measured samples, not the number of displayed FFT points. In the
baseline:

- 128 samples at 1024 samples/s give `T=0.125 s`, an 8 Hz Rayleigh interval,
  and a 16 Hz null-to-null rectangular main lobe;
- 16x padding changes display spacing from 8 Hz to 0.5 Hz, but all three
  physical quantities above stay fixed;
- 512 measured samples give `T=0.5 s`, a 2 Hz Rayleigh interval, and a 4 Hz
  null-to-null main lobe.

Windowing changes the main-lobe and sidelobe constants, as P12 showed, but no
window or padding factor creates observation time.

## Two close tones expose the distinction

The tones are at 198 Hz and 202 Hz, separated by 4 Hz. The 128-sample record
sees only half a Rayleigh interval between them. Its dense 16x plot shows one
smooth blended response centered near 200 Hz. A smoother blend is still a
blend.

The 512-sample record observes two Rayleigh intervals of separation. Relative
phase accumulates for four times as long, the individual main lobes narrow, and
two peaks with a deep midpoint valley become visible. The new separability came
from 384 additional nonzero measurements, not from grid interpolation.

## What zero-padding can improve

Zero-padding is useful. A denser grid can reduce the quantization of a
grid-based peak-location estimate, make lobe shapes legible, align displays,
and support interpolation after the information-bearing measurement. Those
are display or estimation conveniences. They must not be described as narrower
physical main lobes or new ability to distinguish overlapping signals.

## Broken interpretation and recovery

The broken case reports `f_s/N_fft = 0.5 Hz` for the 16x FFT and calls it true
resolution. That would predict that the 4 Hz-separated tones are eight
"resolution cells" apart. Yet the plotted short record still has one blended
peak because its true observation scale is `f_s/N = 8 Hz`.

Recovery labels the two quantities separately:

- **display-grid spacing:** `f_s/N_fft`, which padding can reduce;
- **finite-record Rayleigh interval:** `f_s/N`, which only more measured time
  reduces at fixed sample rate.

## Limiting cases

- **Padding tends to infinity with fixed `N`:** the plotted curve approaches a
  continuous-looking interpolation of the same finite transform; its physical
  main lobe does not shrink.
- **Measured duration grows with fixed `f_s`:** `1/T` decreases and nearby tone
  phase histories become distinguishable.
- **The tones coincide:** no amount of padding or observation time turns one
  frequency into two; they are the same component.
- **Tone separation is far above `1/T`:** even a coarse FFT grid may sample the
  two responses awkwardly, while padding makes their already-present
  separation easier to display.
- **Noise increases:** longer coherent observation can improve measurement, but
  zero-padding still adds no independent noise or signal samples.

## Radar connection and common interpretation mistakes

Range zero-padding creates more plotted range bins but does not beat the
waveform-bandwidth limit. Doppler zero-padding creates more velocity grid
points but does not beat the coherent-processing-interval limit. It may improve
peak interpolation or map presentation, not true target separation.

Common mistakes are calling every FFT point an independent measurement,
equating `f_s/N_fft` with resolution after padding, judging resolution only by
curve smoothness, and comparing a padded short record with an unpadded long
record without separating display spacing from observation duration.

## Prerequisite and next connection

P11 established the FFT grid and P12 established finite-record main lobes. P14
will change the question from resolution to estimator variance by comparing a
single periodogram with averaged Welch segments.

## Use the Python GUI experiment

The GUI keeps the pinned source's mental model and processing order visible. The **zero padding factor** control scales the primary source variable around its documented baseline; **secondary stress** isolates the next important effect; the noise control uses a fixed retained seed so reruns are comparable.

### Prediction and sweep 1 — zero padding factor

Hold secondary stress at 0.25 and predict the response at 0.6×, 1.0×, and 1.4× baseline. State which axis feature should move, which metric should change monotonically, and which quantity should remain invariant. Run those three cases and explain any departure using the governing equations above.

### Sweep 2 — secondary stress

Restore the primary scale to 1.0. Sweep secondary stress through 0.0, 0.5, and 1.0. Separate a genuine model change from a display-scale change, and connect the response to the source lesson's limiting cases.

### Intentionally broken case and recovery

Enable **Violate the central model assumption**. The experiment applies a deterministic ambiguity, contamination, association error, or coherent-processing error appropriate to this curriculum phase. Name the violated assumption before looking at the warning callout. Recover by disabling broken mode, returning primary scale to 1.0 and secondary stress to 0.25, and verifying that the original invariant returns.

## Common mistakes to avoid in the GUI

- Changing two controls at once and attributing the result to only one.
- Reading a smooth plotted line as information that was never measured or modeled.
- Ignoring axis units, normalization, sign, or the finite record/resource ceiling.
- Treating the broken response as random software behavior instead of a named assumption failure.
