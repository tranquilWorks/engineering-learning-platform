# Contrast Real and Complex Sampling

> **Guiding question:** Why can complex samples distinguish positive and negative frequencies?

## Guiding question

Why can complex samples distinguish positive and negative frequencies?

## Physical mental model

A complex sample is a two-coordinate measurement: `I` says where the rotating
arrow points horizontally and `Q` says where it points vertically. Successive
samples show whether the arrow advances counterclockwise or retreats clockwise.
A real sample keeps only the horizontal shadow. The same shadow is cast by an
arrow rotating in either direction, so the sign is lost with Q.

For paired complex tones,

\[
z_+[n]=A e^{j(2\pi f_0 n/f_s+\phi)},\qquad
z_-[n]=A e^{-j(2\pi f_0 n/f_s+\phi)}=z_+^*[n].
\]

Their sample-to-sample phase increments are `+2*pi*f0/fs` and
`-2*pi*f0/fs`. That sign creates counterclockwise and clockwise I/Q motion and
puts their centered-FFT peaks at `+f0` and `-f0`.

Taking only the real part gives

\[
\Re\{z_+[n]\}=\Re\{z_-[n]\}
=A\cos(2\pi f_0 n/f_s+\phi).
\]

The two candidates have become exactly the same sample stream. Its spectrum
must satisfy conjugate symmetry, `X[-k]=X^*[k]`, so magnitude appears at both
`+f0` and `-f0`. Those two lobes are one real cosine, not evidence for two
independent tones.

## Upper and lower RF sides around an LO

P17 changed the reference frame with a negative-exponent complex oscillator.
P18 supplies an upper and lower complex RF side around a 600 Hz LO:

\[
x_U(t)=A e^{j[2\pi(f_{LO}+\Delta)t+\phi]},\qquad
x_L(t)=A e^{j[2\pi(f_{LO}-\Delta)t-\phi]}.
\]

Multiplication by `exp(-j*2*pi*fLO*t)` gives

\[
x_U(t)e^{-j2\pi f_{LO}t}=A e^{j(2\pi\Delta t+\phi)},
\]

\[
x_L(t)e^{-j2\pi f_{LO}t}=A e^{-j(2\pi\Delta t+\phi)}.
\]

Complex downconversion therefore labels the upper side `+Delta` and the lower
side `-Delta`. No low-pass is needed for these already-complex single-side
inputs because multiplication creates one translated component per input.

The real comparison takes the real projection of each RF side and multiplies
it by `2*cos(2*pi*fLO*t)`. Each product contains a difference cosine and a high
sum term. The script constructs a 129-tap windowed-sinc low-pass explicitly and
removes its group delay. After the sum terms are rejected, both difference
outputs reduce to the same `A*cos(2*pi*Delta*t+phi)`. The factor of two is
visible: it compensates the one-half product coefficient from a cosine mixer.
It is distinct from P17's post-filter `2x` convention for complex mixing of a
real input.

## What the two sweeps expose

The frequency-offset sweep changes only `|f|` through 40, 160, and 400 Hz. The
I/Q arrows rotate more quickly while their estimated signs remain opposite;
the real projections still coincide. Speed changes, but the reason sign is
observable does not.

The sample-rate sweep changes only sample rate while holding the 160 Hz
continuous tone, amplitude, phase, and 0.5 s duration fixed. At 2048 and 512
samples/s, the signed discrete-time frequencies remain `+160` and `-160 Hz`.
At 256 samples/s they alias to `-96` and `+96 Hz`. Complex sampling preserves
the sign of the discrete-time rotation it actually measured, but it does not
defeat Nyquist or reveal which analog alias generated those samples.

## The deliberately broken case

The failure takes `real(z)` before estimating signed phase progression. Both
I/Q circles collapse onto the same horizontal line, the paired waveforms have
zero difference, and the complex phase-increment estimator degenerates to a
zero-sign answer. Magnitude plots still look healthy, which is why an I-only
receiver can hide this failure.

Recovery is not `abs(frequency)`. Recovery retains both I and Q, then measures
the signed phase increment or reads a signed centered spectrum. That restores
`+160 Hz` and `-160 Hz` as different observations.

## Limiting cases

- At `f=0`, there is no rotation direction to distinguish; the I/Q point is
  stationary but still retains amplitude and phase.
- At `|f|=fs/2` for even-rate sampling, `exp(+j*pi*n)` and `exp(-j*pi*n)` are
  identical. Positive and negative Nyquist are the same discrete-time point.
- Above the Nyquist interval, complex tones still alias modulo `fs`. I/Q
  distinguishes the signed alias, not the unknown original analog frequency.
- If Q is exactly zero, a nominally complex container carries only real data
  and has the same ambiguity as real sampling.
- Noise makes the rotation estimate fluctuate. Paired noise in this controlled
  experiment is conjugated so frequency sign is the only changed mechanism.
- A real cosine has amplitude `A/2` in each complex spectral copy; a complex
  exponential of amplitude `A` has one copy of amplitude `A`. Compare like
  conventions before interpreting gain.

## Radar connection

After downconversion, target Doppler, beat frequency, and coherent phase live
in I/Q rotation. Energy above and below the receiver LO can have identical real
beat magnitudes but opposite signed phase progression. Keeping Q lets a radar
separate approaching/receding sign conventions, positive/negative Doppler bins,
and upper/lower side information. Discarding Q can turn two physically distinct
returns into the same waveform before later processing even begins.

## Common interpretation mistakes

- Calling negative frequency negative energy; it denotes rotation direction.
- Counting the mirrored lobes of one real cosine as two independent signals.
- Believing a magnitude spectrum alone shows rotation direction.
- Assuming a complex-valued variable is informative when its Q channel was
  discarded or never measured.
- Claiming complex sampling removes the Nyquist limit; it changes the signed
  bandwidth representation but does not remove aliasing.
- Assuming a complex LO applied to a real RF input automatically removes its
  conjugate image. P17 shows that the real input still contains both sides and
  channel selection is required.
- Comparing real-cosine and complex-exponential spectral amplitudes without
  naming the factor-of-two convention.

## Dependencies and execution boundary

P11 supplies the centered signed FFT axis, P12 supplies conjugate-symmetry
intuition, P16 supplies analytic I/Q, and P17 supplies explicit complex mixing
and amplitude bookkeeping. P17 is the declared immediate prerequisite.

The script uses base MATLAB, a private seed, fixed arrays, an explicit FIR, two
bounded three-case sweeps, and six P18-tagged figure groups. It performs no
file, network, audio, timer, parallel, or background work. Ctrl+C cancels the
foreground run. Static repository tests do not prove MATLAB execution or human
interpretation of the plots.

## Use the Python GUI experiment

The GUI keeps the pinned source's mental model and processing order visible. The **signed frequency** control scales the primary source variable around its documented baseline; **secondary stress** isolates the next important effect; the noise control uses a fixed retained seed so reruns are comparable.

### Prediction and sweep 1 — signed frequency

Hold secondary stress at 0.25 and predict the response at 0.6×, 1.0×, and 1.4× baseline. State which axis feature should move, which metric should change monotonically, and which quantity should remain invariant. Run those three cases and explain any departure using the governing equations above.

### Sweep 2 — secondary stress

Restore the primary scale to 1.0. Sweep secondary stress through 0.0, 0.5, and 1.0. Separate a genuine model change from a display-scale change, and connect the response to the source lesson's limiting cases.

### Intentionally broken case and recovery

Enable **Violate the central model assumption**. The experiment applies a deterministic ambiguity, contamination, association error, or coherent-processing error appropriate to this curriculum phase. Name the violated assumption before looking at the warning callout. Recover by disabling broken mode, returning primary scale to 1.0 and secondary stress to 0.25, and verifying that the original invariant returns.

## Common mistakes to avoid in the GUI

- Changing two controls at once and attributing the result to only one.
- Reading a smooth plotted line as information that was never measured or modeled.
- Ignoring axis units, normalization, sign, or the finite record/resource ceiling.
- Treating the broken response as random software behavior instead of a named assumption failure.
