# Create and Equalize a Multipath Channel

## Guiding question

How do delayed copies distort symbols even when noise is small?

## Physical model

A receiver rarely sees only the direct path. Reflections from buildings,
terrain, cables, or impedance discontinuities arrive later and with changed
amplitude and phase. A short discrete channel is

\[
h[n]=\sum_{p=0}^{P-1} a_p\,\delta[n-d_p], \qquad
r[n]=s[n]*h[n]+v[n].
\]

Each coefficient `a_p` is a complex path gain and each `d_p` is a delay. The
convolution says that the receiver adds shifted copies of the pulse-shaped
waveform. P07 introduced this echo-addition view; here the copies extend into
neighboring QPSK decisions.

## Why the symbols smear

P24 arranged the transmit RRC pulse and receive matched filter so that one
isolated path has almost zero response at other symbol times. A path delayed
by one symbol moves the previous symbol directly onto the current decision:

\[
y[k]=h_0x[k]+h_1x[k-1]+h_2x[k-2]+n[k].
\]

The unwanted terms are intersymbol interference (ISI). They depend on nearby
data, so a constellation point becomes a cloud or several displaced clusters
even when `n[k]` is small. In the eye plot, those data-dependent paths cross
the decision time and close the opening.

## The same channel in frequency

The delayed copies add with a frequency-dependent phase:

\[
H(e^{j\omega})=\sum_p h_p e^{-j\omega d_p}.
\]

At some frequencies they reinforce; at others they cancel. This is
frequency-selective fading. For the broken channel
`h=[1, -0.999]`, the paths nearly cancel at zero frequency, leaving a very
deep null. The null and the eye closure are two views of the same convolution,
not separate impairments.

## What the equalizers actually do

Let `H` be the displayed convolution matrix made from the channel taps and
`w` the equalizer taps. The combined impulse response is `H*w`.

The causal zero-forcing (ZF) design in the experiment solves the leading
square system

\[
H_{\text{lead}}w_{\text{ZF}}=\delta.
\]

It cancels the first 30 postcursor terms exactly. For a moderate minimum-phase
channel this leaves a tiny tail. It also filters receiver noise, whose output
variance is proportional to

\[
\sigma_n^2\sum_m |w[m]|^2.
\]

Near a null, inverse taps must work hard. The sum of squared tap magnitudes
grows and so does the noise. A finite ZF filter also pushes uncancelled energy
into its trailing residual; it cannot recreate information that the channel
nearly removed.

The regularized/MMSE-style design instead minimizes

\[
\lVert Hw-\delta\rVert_2^2+\lambda\lVert w\rVert_2^2,
\]

so

\[
w=(H^H H+\lambda I)^{-1}H^H\delta.
\]

The script evaluates this equation with a linear solve rather than forming an
inverse. With `lambda` near the known symbol-sample noise variance, it accepts
some residual ISI to avoid enormous noise gain. This is the important trade:
MMSE does not reverse the channel perfectly; it chooses a lower total error.

## Limiting cases

- With only `h=[1]`, there is no multipath ISI and an equalizer adds no useful
  information.
- With echoes much smaller than the direct path, the spectrum has no deep
  null and both ZF and MMSE can recover tight clusters.
- As an echo approaches equal magnitude and opposite phase, the minimum of
  `|H|` approaches zero. Exact inversion becomes ill-conditioned and noise
  enhancement dominates.
- As `lambda` approaches zero, the regularized solution emphasizes channel
  inversion. As `lambda` becomes large, its taps shrink: noise gain falls but
  residual channel distortion rises.
- More equalizer taps can move the remaining ZF error farther into the tail,
  but they do not make a spectral null contain information again and they
  consume more resources.

## DSP and radar connection

Communication channels create ISI between symbols. Radar receivers meet the
same delayed-copy model as target echoes, clutter, antenna/cable ringing, and
range sidelobe coupling. Whether a delayed copy is desired or interference
depends on the processing goal. In either case, a deep transfer-function null
sets a real limit on deconvolution.

## Common interpretation mistakes

- **“High SNR means a clean constellation.”** High SNR only makes random noise
  small. Deterministic ISI can still dominate.
- **“The weakest path is always harmless.”** Its phase and delay determine
  where it cancels the other paths.
- **“ZF removes all error.”** This ZF is finite and causal; it leaves a trailing
  response and may strongly amplify noise.
- **“MMSE failed because residual ISI remains.”** MMSE deliberately leaves
  some ISI when removing it would create more noise error.
- **“An equalizer creates lost signal energy.”** It reweights observations. It
  cannot recover a frequency component that was exactly erased.

## Dependencies

P24 provides unit-energy QPSK pulse shaping, matched filtering, timing, and eye
language. P23 provides IQ decisions, P07 provides convolution as echo addition,
and P09 provides FIR/frequency-response language. The experiment uses base
MATLAB and exposes every essential operation; it does not use `comm.LinearEqualizer`,
`equalize`, `awgn`, `rcosdesign`, or another Communications Toolbox black box.

## Use the Python GUI experiment

The GUI keeps the pinned source's mental model and processing order visible. The **multipath delay** control scales the primary source variable around its documented baseline; **secondary stress** isolates the next important effect; the noise control uses a fixed retained seed so reruns are comparable.

### Prediction and sweep 1 — multipath delay

Hold secondary stress at 0.25 and predict the response at 0.6×, 1.0×, and 1.4× baseline. State which axis feature should move, which metric should change monotonically, and which quantity should remain invariant. Run those three cases and explain any departure using the governing equations above.

### Sweep 2 — secondary stress

Restore the primary scale to 1.0. Sweep secondary stress through 0.0, 0.5, and 1.0. Separate a genuine model change from a display-scale change, and connect the response to the source lesson's limiting cases.

### Intentionally broken case and recovery

Enable **Violate the central model assumption**. The experiment applies a deterministic ambiguity, contamination, association error, or coherent-processing error appropriate to this curriculum phase. Name the violated assumption before looking at the warning callout. Recover by disabling broken mode, returning primary scale to 1.0 and secondary stress to 0.25, and verifying that the original invariant returns.

## Common mistakes to avoid in the GUI

- Changing two controls at once and attributing the result to only one.
- Reading a smooth plotted line as information that was never measured or modeled.
- Ignoring axis units, normalization, sign, or the finite record/resource ceiling.
- Treating the broken response as random software behavior instead of a named assumption failure.
