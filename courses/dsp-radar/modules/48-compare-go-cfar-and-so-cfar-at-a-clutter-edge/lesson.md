# Compare GO-CFAR and SO-CFAR at a Clutter Edge

> **Guiding question:** Which side of a changing background should control the threshold?

## Start with the physical edge

Imagine walking outward in range from quiet ground into a much brighter
clutter region. A CUT close to that boundary can have quiet reference cells on
one side and bright reference cells on the other. There is no single local
background level for the window to average: the two halves describe different
physical regions.

P48 calls lower-index cells the leading/left side and higher-index cells the
lagging/right side. Those names do not decide the result. GO and SO respond to
the larger or smaller estimate regardless of which geometric side contains
the bright region.

## Expose both one-sided estimates

For `T` training cells on each side and `G` guards, the script forms linear
power means

`m_left(k) = (1/T) * sum(z(k-G-T : k-G-1))`

and

`m_right(k) = (1/T) * sum(z(k+G+1 : k+G+T))`.

The CUT and guards do not contribute. Greatest-of and smallest-of CFAR then
select

`m_GO = max(m_left, m_right)`

`m_SO = min(m_left, m_right)`.

The selected mean is multiplied by a detector-specific scale before comparing
it with CUT power. The `max` and `min` are visible in `experiment.m`; no CFAR
toolbox object hides the stencil or decision.

## Equal Pfa requires separate scale factors

Even in homogeneous exponential power, the maximum of two noisy means and the
minimum of those means have different distributions. Reusing one CA-CFAR scale
would make an unfair GO/SO comparison.

Let `X` and `Y` be independent means of `T` unit-mean exponential training
powers. For a candidate multiplier `a`, P48 evaluates

`Pfa_SO(a) = 2 * sum(q_k(a), k = 0...T-1)`

where

`q_k(a) = T^(T+k) * Gamma(T+k) / (Gamma(T) * k! * (2*T+a)^(T+k))`,

and

`Pfa_GO(a) = 2 * (T/(T+a))^T - Pfa_SO(a)`.

A fixed-iteration bisection finds one multiplier for each variant at the same
requested homogeneous `Pfa`. With `T = 12` per side and `Pfa = 1e-3`, GO uses
about `7.0890` and SO uses about `10.4809`. GO's selected estimate is larger,
but its calibrated multiplier is smaller. Therefore it is wrong to claim that
the GO threshold exceeds the SO threshold at every homogeneous sample.

## Why GO protects a clutter rise

Consider a high-clutter CUT just beyond the edge. One reference mean still
looks into low clutter and the other sees high clutter. SO chooses the quiet
side, so its threshold remains much too low for the high-power CUT population.
False alarms rise sharply. GO chooses the bright side and keeps the threshold
tied to the population containing the CUT.

The cost appears for a low-side target just before the rise. GO may let the
bright side control even though the CUT still belongs to low clutter. Its high
threshold can miss that target. “Conservative” means protection against false
alarms, not universal superiority.

## Why SO can preserve a target beside an interferer

In homogeneous clutter, place a strong second target in only one training
half. GO selects that contaminated mean, lifts the threshold, and can mask a
weaker target in the CUT. SO selects the clean half and can preserve the weak
target. This benefit lasts only while one side remains representative. If both
halves are contaminated, or the smaller side is from the wrong clutter
population, SO has no magic protection.

## The deliberately broken comparison

The ordinary 24-cell CA scale is between the correct GO and SO scales. Applying
that shared value to both variants makes GO more conservative than requested
and SO less conservative than requested. A plot that then compares detection
counts is not comparing the same operating point. Recovery calibrates the two
variants separately before interpreting edge or interferer behavior.

A second tempting mistake is to pick SO everywhere because it preserved the
weak target in the one-sided-contamination sweep. At the 12 dB clutter rise,
that choice spends a large number of high-side false alarms. Recovery is not a
claim that GO always wins; it selects GO when clutter-edge false-alarm control
is the protected failure.

## Limiting cases and boundaries

- At zero clutter contrast, there is no physical edge bias. GO and SO still
  have different finite-sample statistics, but separate calibration gives both
  the same homogeneous design `Pfa`.
- As the high/low contrast grows, a high-side SO CUT can compare high CUT power
  with a low-side estimate; its false-alarm probability tends toward one.
- A low-side GO target whose window reaches arbitrarily bright clutter becomes
  increasingly likely to be missed at fixed local SNR.
- As `T` grows without bound in representative homogeneous data, both side
  means approach the true mean and both multipliers approach `-log(Pfa)`.
- More cells do not fix a window that spans two populations. P46's geometry
  lesson still applies.

## What the experiment establishes

This is a deterministic simulated square-law model with independent
exponential background powers, an abrupt two-region mean, isolated baseline
target probes, and a deliberate one-sided training contaminator. It does not
validate rare-event `Pfa`, correlated or measured clutter, fluctuating targets,
2-D CFAR, sidelobes, hardware, or an operational radar.

## Use the Python GUI experiment

The GUI keeps the pinned source's mental model and processing order visible. The **clutter edge ratio** control scales the primary source variable around its documented baseline; **secondary stress** isolates the next important effect; the noise control uses a fixed retained seed so reruns are comparable.

### Prediction and sweep 1 — clutter edge ratio

Hold secondary stress at 0.25 and predict the response at 0.6×, 1.0×, and 1.4× baseline. State which axis feature should move, which metric should change monotonically, and which quantity should remain invariant. Run those three cases and explain any departure using the governing equations above.

### Sweep 2 — secondary stress

Restore the primary scale to 1.0. Sweep secondary stress through 0.0, 0.5, and 1.0. Separate a genuine model change from a display-scale change, and connect the response to the source lesson's limiting cases.

### Intentionally broken case and recovery

Enable **Violate the central model assumption**. The experiment applies a deterministic ambiguity, contamination, association error, or coherent-processing error appropriate to this curriculum phase. Name the violated assumption before looking at the warning callout. Recover by disabling broken mode, returning primary scale to 1.0 and secondary stress to 0.25, and verifying that the original invariant returns.

## Common mistakes to avoid in the GUI

- Changing two controls at once and attributing the result to only one.
- Reading a smooth plotted line as information that was never measured or modeled.
- Ignoring axis units, normalization, sign, or the finite record/resource ceiling.
- Treating the broken response as random software behavior instead of a named assumption failure.
