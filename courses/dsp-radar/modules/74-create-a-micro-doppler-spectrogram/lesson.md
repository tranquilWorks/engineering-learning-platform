# Create a Micro-Doppler Spectrogram

## Guiding question

How do rotating or swinging target parts produce time-varying Doppler around bulk motion?

## One target can contain several velocities

A conventional point-target description gives one range and one radial
velocity. A walking person is not one rigid point. The torso may approach at a
nearly steady speed while arms and legs alternately move faster and slower
than the torso. Each scattering part contributes its own coherent phasor to
the selected range-bin return.

This experiment uses three ideal point scatterers: a strong torso and two
weaker, oppositely swinging limbs. It is deliberately small enough that every
stage remains visible. P70 supplies the selected FMCW range-bin viewpoint;
fast-time range processing is not repeated here.

## From component motion to coherent phase

Positive radial velocity means approaching. For component `i`,

```text
v_i(t) = v_bulk + v_micro,i(t)
f_d,i(t) = 2 v_i(t) / lambda
```

where `lambda = c/f_c`. A sinusoidal limb model is

```text
v_limb,A(t) = v_bulk + v_swing cos(2 pi f_swing t)
v_limb,B(t) = v_bulk + v_swing cos(2 pi f_swing t + pi).
```

Velocity must be integrated before constructing phase. The associated radial
advance is

```text
d_i(t) = integral from 0 to t of v_i(u) du.
```

The selected dechirped range-bin convention inherited from P70-P73 is

```text
x_i(t) = a_i exp(-j 4 pi d_i(t)/lambda + j phi_i).
```

Thus approaching motion has negative raw slow-time FFT frequency. The script
reverses both the complex FFT rows and their axis before plotting so the
displayed physical Doppler `f_d = +2v/lambda` increases left to right. Reversing
only the labels would be wrong.

Writing `exp(-j 2 pi f_d(t)t)` would not model time-varying velocity correctly:
its phase derivative contains an extra `t df_d/dt` term. Direct displacement,
or equivalently integrated Doppler, avoids that mistake.

The received signal is the coherent sum

```text
x(t) = sum_i x_i(t) + n(t).
```

Because phasors add before magnitude is taken, their cancellation can create
amplitude nulls and composite-phase jumps. The raw unwrapped phase is useful
evidence that motion is present, but its local slope is not a trustworthy label
for any one body part near a cancellation.

## What the dwell-wide spectrum loses

A full-record FFT projects all four seconds onto constant-frequency bins. The
strong torso creates energy near the bulk Doppler. Periodic limb phase
modulation spreads energy through a sideband pattern. That spectrum proves the
return is not one pure Doppler tone, but it cannot say when a limb was above or
below the torso velocity. A sideband line is not automatically a separate
constant-velocity target.

## The explicit STFT

For frame `m`, the script extracts a finite section, multiplies it by an
explicit Hann window, and computes a two-sided complex FFT:

```text
X[m,k] = sum_n x[n + mH] w[n] exp(-j 2 pi k n/Nfft).
```

`H` is the hop. `fftshift` exposes negative and positive raw frequencies; the
row-and-axis reversal then maps them to signed physical Doppler. Frame time is
the center of the window, not its first sample. No `spectrogram`, `stft`,
`pspectrum`, `instfreq`, or toolbox window call hides these operations.

The spectrogram shows a near-horizontal torso ridge around `+192 Hz` and
periodic limb energy sweeping about `+/-320 Hz` around it. Track crossings and
coherent interference can make a local maximum switch identity; the theoretical
component tracks are guides, not detector declarations.

## Three controlled changes

### Peak swing speed

Changing only `v_swing` changes the micro-Doppler extent

```text
Delta f_micro = 2 v_swing / lambda.
```

The bulk ridge and swing repetition rate stay fixed. Faster limbs spread the
periodic tracks farther above and below bulk Doppler. The experiment uses one
fixed nominal scatterer-power noise scale and reuses the same deterministic
additive-noise record in all three cases, so background
changes cannot masquerade as a speed effect.

### Carrier frequency

At fixed physical velocities, Doppler in hertz scales with carrier:

```text
f_d = 2 v f_c / c.
```

The `10`, `24`, and `77 GHz` cases show increasing bulk offset and micro-Doppler
width in hertz. Converting each axis back with `v = lambda f_d/2` would recover
the same physical velocities. This is wavelength sensitivity, not faster
motion.

### STFT window duration

All window cases process the exact same complex record on the same zero-padded
FFT display grid. The physical finite-window response is set approximately by
`1/T_window`, not by the displayed bin spacing:

- a short window follows rapid motion in time but spreads each local Doppler;
- a long window narrows constant-frequency response but averages across a
  larger fraction of the swing and smears curved tracks;
- overlap changes report density, not independent physical resolution.

Zero-padding provides a denser display between samples of the window response;
it does not manufacture a longer observation.

## The intentionally broken case

The broken path evaluates `abs(x)` before the STFT. The common bulk phasor is
removed, signed rotation is lost, and the strongest energy collapses toward
DC. Relative beating between coherent parts can remain, so the magnitude-only
plot is not required to be featureless; it simply cannot retain absolute
signed bulk and component Doppler.

Recovery does not synthesize a cleaner target or change a parameter. It reruns
the explicit STFT on the unchanged complex measurement. An equality assertion
protects that same-data boundary.

## Limiting cases and model boundaries

- `v_swing = 0`: all parts share bulk Doppler; the periodic spread vanishes.
- `v_bulk = 0`: the torso lies at zero while limb tracks cross positive and
  negative Doppler.
- `f_c -> 0`: Doppler in hertz shrinks for the same physical velocity.
- `f_swing = 0`: the sinusoidal displacement formula is undefined; this
  experiment rejects that malformed control rather than silently changing the
  model.
- A window as long as the dwell approaches the dwell-wide spectrum and loses
  most timing information.
- Slow-time Doppler must remain inside Nyquist. Aliased tracks can fold and
  imitate a different component velocity; validation checks the worst reviewed
  speed at the highest carrier before allocation.
- At exact phasor cancellation, composite phase is ill-conditioned even though
  every component phase is well-defined.
- Several scattering parts in one range cell cannot be uniquely associated
  merely by tracing the brightest spectrogram pixel through a crossing.

The synthetic point-scatterer model omits range migration, aspect-dependent
RCS, occlusion, multipath, acceleration outside the sinusoid, antenna pattern,
phase noise, clutter, leakage from adjacent range bins, and classifier logic.
It is not a biomechanical walking model or rotor certification case.

## Dependencies, resources, and compatibility

P15 provides STFT intuition, P18 signed I/Q, P36 coherent Doppler phase, P70
the selected-range-bin context, and P73 the governed prerequisite. The script
targets base MATLAB R2016b or newer with no optional toolbox. It is synchronous:
no worker, timer, network, hardware, or external persistent state is created.

The reviewed ceilings are 20,000 slow-time samples, 4,096 STFT FFT points,
65,536 dwell-spectrum FFT points, 1,000 frames per STFT, five cases per sweep,
50,000 private generator values, 15,000,000 eight-byte live-workspace value
equivalents (complex values count twice and container overhead is included),
and five tagged figure groups. Static tests and a Python oracle do not prove MATLAB
runtime, plot legibility, educational effectiveness, RF behavior, hardware/HIL,
bench, real-time RT1/RT2, field, Unreal, signing, deployment, staging,
production, or operational-radar performance.

## Use the Python GUI experiment

The GUI keeps the pinned source's mental model and processing order visible. The **micro motion rate** control scales the primary source variable around its documented baseline; **secondary stress** isolates the next important effect; the noise control uses a fixed retained seed so reruns are comparable.

### Prediction and sweep 1 — micro motion rate

Hold secondary stress at 0.25 and predict the response at 0.6×, 1.0×, and 1.4× baseline. State which axis feature should move, which metric should change monotonically, and which quantity should remain invariant. Run those three cases and explain any departure using the governing equations above.

### Sweep 2 — secondary stress

Restore the primary scale to 1.0. Sweep secondary stress through 0.0, 0.5, and 1.0. Separate a genuine model change from a display-scale change, and connect the response to the source lesson's limiting cases.

### Intentionally broken case and recovery

Enable **Violate the central model assumption**. The experiment applies a deterministic ambiguity, contamination, association error, or coherent-processing error appropriate to this curriculum phase. Name the violated assumption before looking at the warning callout. Recover by disabling broken mode, returning primary scale to 1.0 and secondary stress to 0.25, and verifying that the original invariant returns.

## Common mistakes to avoid in the GUI

- Changing two controls at once and attributing the result to only one.
- Reading a smooth plotted line as information that was never measured or modeled.
- Ignoring axis units, normalization, sign, or the finite record/resource ceiling.
- Treating the broken response as random software behavior instead of a named assumption failure.
